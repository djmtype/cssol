## Overview

### Space Size

The base space size utilizes a `clamp` function on the `html` element for better readability.

```css
:where(html) {
  --space-size: clamp(1rem, calc(0.9rem + 0.3vw), 1.25rem);
}
```

Providing a value for `--space-size-value` will override the initial setting located in `settings.css`.


### Space Scale

The default space scale is set to `1.25`. 

Providing a value for `--space-scale-value` will override the initial setting located in `settings.css`. 

An alias value of `--gutter` has also been provided as a means to provide consistency. Its default value is set to `--space-md`. 

Providing a value for `--gutter-size` will override the initial `--gutter` value located in `settings.css`.
