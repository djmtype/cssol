The color space being used by SOL is `oklch`. Why `oklch`? It's much easier to predict color contrast compared to using other color spaces like `rgb` or `hsl`.

While all major browsers natively support `oklch`, it's important to support *all* browsers. Therefore, PostCSS is being utilized to generate fallback values for unsupported browsers. 
 
In order for PostCSS to transform these values, the `oklch` function can not contain other css variables. 

❌ `--color-prop: oklch(99% .03 var(--hue))`  
❌ `--color-prop: oklch(99% .03 var(--hue, 270))`  
✅ `--color-prop: oklch(99% .03 270)`
